I need help in upgrade the tool for validate text strings, it works based on two fields into which I paste text, in the left field there is the text to be checked and in the right field there is a pattern/template that contains more texts and comments that describe when given paragraphs and provisions apply. Just so you have a better idea. It's about checking documents and static text. The purpose of the tool is to mark in green text/words that are duplicated. The logical explanation is that we have two word banks which words from the right text box are in the left text box and color them green.
