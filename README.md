I need help in upgrade the tool for validate text strings, it works based on two fields into which I paste text, in the left field there is the text to be checked and in the right field there is a pattern/template that contains more texts and comments that describe when given paragraphs and provisions apply. Just so you have a better idea. It's about checking documents and static text. The purpose of the tool is to mark in green text/words that are duplicated. The logical explanation is that we have two word banks one of them we need compare with template of document, these cointains words from the right and left text box, we need to color the same words green in the left text box which are the same in the right text box of our pattern.
